# Enhancement Turrets
### Introduction
This mod is an addition to the EU and does not add new content, but uses a ready-made one. Also, do not expect any balance from this mod, because the mod is positioned as entertainment content, and not as a serious addition to an existing game. Finally, this mod will be developed gradually - everything will depend on which units will be updated in the EU and what the progress of the scenario in ALE will be. To put it simply, don't expect this mod to be updated as often as my main one.
## Conclusion
Well, that's it, expect good news from me on EU and now also on ET mods! :D

#### P.S. Not that this is important, but the mod itself was originally planned for ALE maps, and in general, my final goal has not changed. However, you can use this mod for your own purposes, I do not forbid you and I cannot.
